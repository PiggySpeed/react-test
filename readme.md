#  React-Test
`react-test` is a development environment that lets you prototype
components within an electron-react application.

This will also help teach you about some of the web development
technologies out there.

(I'm considering changing the name of this repo to react + electron =
`reactron`)

## Start
To start using this code:
1. Ensure you have the latest version of nodejs/npm installed
2. Open a console and enter "npm install"
3. Open a console and enter "npm run-script watch"
4. Open another console and enter "npm start"

To run the code in the future, you only need to run steps 3 and 4.

## Introduction
We are using a tech stack that allows us to build a responsive desktop
application using web technologies. This document with help you become
familiarized with all the different libraries and modules that we are 
using.

* node.js
* npm
* ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
* jsx
* Babel

* Electron
* React
* Less
* Material-UI

* Webpack

* Express
* jquery
* mysql

* react-devtools

## node.js

## npm

## ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)

## jsx

## Babel

## Electron
Electron lets us create a desktop application using web technologies.

## React
React makes rendering web pages faster. React creates a copy of the DOM,
called the virtual DOM, and uses it to calculate any changes that happen
with the DOM. 

## Less

## Material-UI

## Flexboxgrid

## Webpack
